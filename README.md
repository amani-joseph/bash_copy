# ðŸ“‚ Copy Files Script

A Bash utility that **recursively copies files** from a source directory (and its subdirectories) into a single flat target directory.  
It avoids filename conflicts, supports renaming with patterns, and automatically organizes video files (`.mp4`) into a dedicated `videos/` folder.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… **Recursive copy**: Collects all files from nested directories.  
- âœ… **Conflict-safe**: If duplicate filenames exist, the script generates unique names using path-based hashes.  
- âœ… **Custom renaming**: Use the `-r` flag with a pattern to rename files in sequence (e.g., `file_001.txt`, `file_002.txt`).  
- âœ… **Video isolation**: `.mp4` files are automatically placed into a `videos/` subdirectory inside the target.  
- âœ… **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS and Linux.
